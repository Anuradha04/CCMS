#  CCMS - Clubs and Chapters Management System

The **Clubs and Chapters Management System (CCMS)** is a centralized digital platform developed to address the lack of awareness and engagement among students regarding college clubs, chapters, and events. The system enhances communication, visibility, and coordination between students, board members, and the **Department of Student Welfare (DSW)** by offering dedicated interfaces for each user group.
